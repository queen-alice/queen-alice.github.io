Get started with CSCA20
Search for Wing IDE and open it on your computer
Python is the porgramming language we are using for this course and 
Wing is the integrated development environment designed specifically made for 
python
Make a new python file called csca20_01.py by clicking file -> new and then 
save it 
There are 2 major concoles(editor, python shell)
Any code you want to save must be written in the editor.
Any results of the code written in the editor
will be displayed in the python shell.
Python shell is great for tesing purposes 
You should be ready to go now!!!!


Let's practice some commands!
command: print()
When you run the command by clicking the green arrow on the top of the this page,
it will create a line of output in the python shell.
print() is the name of the Python command which sends messages to the ouput
() contains what you want to print and the text you want to
print goes into " "
print("Bonjour, tout le monde")
And you can print many other objects
single quotes would also work in this case 
print('My name is Alice')

What are variables? 
Variables act like a "storage location" for data in the program and a way of
naming information for later usage 
<variable name> = <the value you want to store>
x = 1134134
y = 23465337
What's the sum of x and y?


What is a data type?
It is the type of a variable
input_str = "12"
print(input_str, "is", "of type ", type(input_str))
input_integer = 12
print(input_integer, "is", "of type ", type(input_integer))
common types: floats, booleans, strings...

Type Conversion by using methods 
int(), float(), str()...
1. converting integers to floats
float(3)
2. converting floats to intergers
int(3.435)
3. converting with strings
we can convert numbers to strings 
str(3) 
str(3.456)
we can also convert strings to numbers
int('3')
float('3.456')
4. converting a value to boolean
bool(3)
bool('abc')
bool(0)
